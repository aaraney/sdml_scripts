# Getting Started Guide

### Overview
If you have never used github before, welcome! I think that you will find it very useful for colaborating with others and sharing files _once it is setup_. This guide by no means will attempt to cover and explain all that GitHub is and has to offer. Rather, it will focus on getting you setup quickly so you too can reap the benefits of a structured repository. 
If you are looking for an extremely thorough guide [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) is a link to GitHub's guide site. I would highly recommend reading to better understand the structure and workflow of GitHub.

### Installation
For this guide, I will walk you through the installation of GitHub's desktop application. GitHub is often run in the terminal and to be safe many would argue that the
command line interface is much more _powerful_, but for the sake of this repo we will stick to the desktop application for ease of use sake. Plus, it is platform independent. 
1. Please follow [this](https://desktop.github.com) link and download the version of GitHub Desktop that suites your operating system.
2. Once GitHub Desktop has been installed, open it. You should be greeted with a welcome screen asking you to either sign in or create a free account. Please sign in if you 
already have an account. If you do not have an account please create one now and sign in to the app. For reference you account type will be GitHub not GitHub Enterprise.

### Getting Setup -- Cloning a Repository
1. After signing in, you should see a few options. Select "Clone a Repository." 
2. Select the "URL" option in the Clone a Repository window. Copy and Paste `https://github.com/aaraney/sdml_scripts.git` into the URL box. 
3. Click "Choose" to choose a local path or folder where the cloned repository will live on your computer. I would suggest creating a new 
empty folder called "sdml\_scripts" and choosing it for your local path. You can think of cloning a repo as downloading
all of the files in a repo to a special folder that allows you to pull down new items that are added to that folder by others and also
(if the repo owner lets you) push changes such as edited files or completely new files to the repo.
4. Click "Clone"
5. So now, open up your file explorer and navigate to your newly cloned repo. You should see that it looks exactly the same as the one online. 

### Adding a script
Before adding a file, please read the [style_guide.md](../style_guide.md).
